\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{1\baselineskip}
\item Excepted appointments allow the president the flexibility he needs to make many appointments quickly.
\item The case of the Department of Homeland Security headquarters suggests these appointees can be used to fill positions quickly in a brand new and very salient agency.
\item A preliminary regression model also suggests that the president places Schedule C appointees into ideologically dissimilar agencies, perhaps to bring naturally opposed bureaus more in line with his policy agenda.
\item Overall, this project is meant to serve as evidence that Schedule C appointees are a tool in the president's unilateral toolbox and deserve further study.
